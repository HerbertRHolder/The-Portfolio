            <div class="paper">
                OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of
                "objects", which can contain data and code that manipulates that data. In OOP, you define "classes" that
                represent real-world objects, and you create "instances" of those classes to carry out tasks. One of the
                main benefits of OOP is that it allows developers to create modular and reusable code, which can make it
                easier to develop and maintain complex software systems. OOP languages include Java, C++, and Python,
                among others.

            <div id="encapsulation"></div>
            <h1  class="mt-5 fs-2">Encapsulation</h1>

            <div class="paper">
                Encapsulation is the technique of hiding the properties and method details of an object from outside the
                class, and providing a controlled interface through which the object can be accessed and manipulated.
                This act of closing off allows the object to change without affecting the code that uses it.
                Encapsulation provides a level of security for the internal state of the object by limiting unauthorized
                access in addition to promoting modularity and reusability of programming.
            </div>
            <p>Here is an example of encapsulation</p>
            <img class="w-75 img-fluid" src="img/javaExampl1.png" alt="">
            <div class="paper">
                <p>
                    Here you can see that the Animal class has 2 fields type and legs. Where encapsulation takes place
                    is when we set the keyword <span class="fw-bold">private</span> to each object field. The reason why
                    we use the keyword <span class="fw-bold">private</span> is to keep other parts outside of the class
                    from using these object fields. This privatization is generally used to allow each object to use
                    their fields as one whole entity. This concept derives itself from the real world. Example, a dog is
                    known to have 4 legs, someone can't just make a dog have 5 legs because 4 legs are attributed to a
                    dog.

            <div class="paper">
                <p>
                    With the help of polymorphism, several data types can be handled by a single function or method in
                    object-oriented programming. This enables more adaptable and reuseable code. Polymorphism is the
                    capacity of a single function or method to operate on a variety of data types. Along with
                    inheritance and encapsulation, it is one of the core ideas in object-oriented programming.

                <p>
                    Here you can see that the method <code>add()</code> is written twice but one metrhod returns an
                    integer and the other returns a double. This allows the client using this method to be able to
                    perform the same process but with different data types. This idea of taking up multiple forms is
                    know as polymorphism. Another word used with polymorphism is overriding a method.

            <div class="paper">

                <p>
                    To abstract away something is to bury the implementation details within something, which can be a
                    prototype or a function. Therefore, you are not required to fully comprehend the function's purpose
                    while calling it. You would never write any code if you had to comprehend every single function in a
                    large codebase. It would take weeks or months to read everything. By removing some details, you can
                    produce a reusable, easily understandable, and adaptable codebase.

                <p>
                    When anything has to be extended, an abstract class is used to represent it. Let's imagine that we
                    wish to use an application to model employees and their various job roles. The work that each person
                    performs depends on their position, even if we are aware that each employee will have a name and be
                    a part of a department. We may create a class called Employee and is used for specific employment
                    positions that extend Employee to simulate this scenario. To require implementation from subclasses,
                    we can make the Employee class abstract and define an abstract method inside of it.

            <div class="paper">
                <p>
                    Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class (called the child class
                    or subclass) inherits the properties and methods of another class (called the parent class or
                    superclass). This allows you to reuse and organize your code, as well as the ability to model
                    real-world relationships between different objects. The child class can also add or override
                    properties and methods of the parent class.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paper">
                <p>A good example of inheritance would be the image above this. The Developer class inherits the Employee super class.
