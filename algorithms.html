                Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science. Data structures are
                used to organize and store data efficiently, while algorithms are used to manipulate and process
                that data. Together, data structures and algorithms form the basis of many computer programs, and
                they are essential tools for improving the efficiency and performance of those programs. The study
                of data structures and algorithms is an important part of computer science because these concepts
                are used to design and analyze efficient solutions to a wide variety of problems. Feeling

            <h1 class="fs-2">Merge Sort</h1>
            <div class="paper">
                One algorithm we can talk about is the mergesort algorithm. It is an
                algorithm that uses a technique known as divide-and-conquer which breaks down a problem into smaller
                pieces. This breaking down process makes it more efficient in solving each individual problem
                separately.
            </div>
            <div class="paper">
                It is a recursive algorithm which continuously splits an array in half until it cannot be further
                divided. So this means The base case to stop the recursion is when there is either no elements in the
                array or at least one element. However if the array has multiple elements, split the array into halves
                and recursively invoke the merge sort on each of the halves. Lastly, when both halves are sorted, the
                merge operation is applied. Merge operation is a action of taking two smaller sorted arrays and
                combining them to eventually make a larger one. In the end each piece merges to create a new sorted
                array.

                    Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it a good choice for sorting large lists. It
                    is a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of elements with equal keys is preserved by the
                    sort. Merge sort is also an example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm.

                <p>
                    Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm that like mergesort uses a divide-and-conquer approach
                    to
                    sort a list of items. It works by selecting a "pivot" element from the list, and partitioning the
                    other
                    elements into two lists based on whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The two
                    sublists
                    are then recursively sorted using the same quicksort algorithm.

                    Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the
                    minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and adding it to the sorted part of the list. In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (given ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the beginning of unsorted subarray. 
                    After every iteration the sorted subarray size increases by one and the unsorted subarray size decrease by one.

                    Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it less efficient than other sorting algorithms for large lists. However, it has the advantage of being simple to implement and requiring a small amount of additional memory. Selection sort is not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of elements with equal keys may be changed by the sort.

                    1. Building a heap: This step rearranges the array into a binary heap, which is a complete binary tree with the property that the value of each parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This step takes O(n) time.

                <div class="paper text-start">
                    2. Sorting the heap: This step repeatedly removes the maximum element from the heap and puts it at the end of the sorted array. This step takes O(nlogn) time, since there are n elements in the heap and removing the maximum element from the heap takes log(n) time.

                    Overall, heapsort has a time complexity of O(nlogn). It is not an in-place sort, since it requires an additional array to store the sorted elements. However, it is relatively simple to implement and has good performance in practice.

                        Data structures are used to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. There are many different types of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each type of data structure is designed to store data in a specific way, and has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some data structures are better suited for certain tasks, while others may be more efficient for different types of data or operations. Understanding the characteristics and trade-offs of different data structures is an important part of designing and implementing efficient algorithms and software systems.

                        A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is a separate object, consisting of a node and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. The main advantage of linked lists over arrays is that elements can be inserted or removed from the list without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure. However, linked lists require more memory overhead to store the references, so they are less efficient for cases where the size of the list is fixed or the majority of operations are element access rather than insertion or deletion. The size flexibility in linked lists can make them use less memory overall. This is useful when there is uncertainty about size or there are large variations in the size of data elements.

                        Here you can see that a linked list consists of a series of node objects. Each node object has an address and a data attribute. In C++, the address is known to be stored in a pointer object. Each pointer object points to each node with a memory address location number, usually this is in hexadecimal.
